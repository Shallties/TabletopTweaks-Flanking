## This is a TabletopTweaks mod and requires [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases) [![Download zip](https://custom-icon-badges.herokuapp.com/badge/-Download-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=download&logoColor=white "Download zip")](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases/latest/download/TabletopTweaks-Core.zip)

This module replaces Owlcat's homebrew flanking mechanics with mechanics more accurate to pathfinder. The exact parameters used are configurable to make flanking more or less difficult as desired. Additionally it add some supporting feats for flanking.

Once a game is saved with this mod is enabled it will require this mod to be present to load so do not remove or disable the mod once enabled. You can however use the "Disable All Flanking Mechanics" setting to disable all changes to the game.

All changes are configurable and can be disabled via the unity mod manager menu.
